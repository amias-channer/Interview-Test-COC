# Interview-Test-COC   (WIP)

[TOC]

## About 

### Introduction

This document is an attempt at a public specification of a Code of Conduct for interview technical tests.  The idea is to provide a community reference point for what is acceptable conduct for an interview technical test. This document aims to satisfy the potentially conflicting goals of technical tests. In the interests of brevity we will focus just on the tests not the wider interview process. For the same reasons this isn't the place to dwell on the politics of structural racism but in the interests of accuracy this document will acknowledge that it exists and that we all have a duty to avoid it.

### What is a Technical Test ?

Any coding exercise undertaken for the purposes of candidate evaluation for a job interview.

### Why do we need a COC ?

Lots of companies apply technical tests for job interviews, these tests can vary in quality massively and often have unwanted side effects. There is a lot of debate around the efficacy of these tests and whether they are fair or accurate, this is an attempt to normalise them to a positive community led standard we can build apon.

### Contribution

This document is an open source effort started by Amias Channer , contributions are welcome in the following forms:

pull requests :  https://github.com/amias-channer/Interview-Test-COC 
raising issues:  https://github.com/amias-channer/Interview-Test-COC/issues.  

If there is interest i will gladly build this into community project with appropriate shared governance.

## Guidelines

### Duration

Its unfair to expect candidates to do hours of work for technical test, while some might have free time to spare others with families, disabilities or financial issues will not so they will not continue or apply.

Expecting candidates to push themselves overly hard like this will not necessarily get you balanced reliable employees.

If you do agile you should consider choosing a task that fits in your planning unit size, if you only allow tasks to be greater than 1hr and less than 4hrs long then you shouldn't be giving tests that take 8hrs.

### Complexity

Be sure to set challenges that are of appropriate complexity for the level of work candidate would be doing if they got the job.

Get your lead dev to design the test but make sure you that it can be completed by someone at the same level, this is a good opportunity for pair programming. 



## Deliverables

### Background

Candidates should be able to expect their work to have to reasonable consideration before expending  effort on unpaid work. Employers must ensure they inform the candidate how many other people are doing the test and how the project will be assessed. 

### Code

### Repository

### Docker

### Ownership

Any code or artefacts created during the test remain the property of the candidate, this should be enforced by the use of a GPL3 licence. This ensures the company cant use this process to get free dev time.
